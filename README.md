# Sales-Growth-and-Product-Performance-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales order data to derive meaningful insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. The dataset contains key attributes like order details, product categories, pricing, discount percentages, and geographical information. By utilizing SQL for querying and Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, this project aims to provide actionable insights into improving business operations, optimizing pricing strategies, and enhancing sales performance.

## Programming Languages and Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (Data Querying)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Data Exploration, Visualization)

## Project Use Cases
1. **Optimizing Sales Strategies**: Understand how different segments and regions perform in terms of sales volume and profitability.
2. **Pricing and Discount Analysis**: Explore the impact of discount percentages on product sales and profit margins.
3. **Category-wise Sales Performance**: Analyze which product categories and subcategories contribute most to overall revenue.
4. **Shipping Mode Efficiency**: Assess the relationship between shipping modes and delivery times to optimize logistics.
5. **Customer Segmentation**: Identify key trends across customer segments to tailor marketing and product offerings.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- The raw retail sales data was loaded into the environment using Jupyter Notebooks for analysis.
- Cleaned and transformed the data to ensure consistency and handle missing values.
- SQL queries using MsSQL Server were used to filter and aggregate specific portions of the data for deeper analysis.

### 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analysis
- **Measure 1**: Total Sales Revenue.
- **Measure 2**: Average Discount Applied.
- **Measure 3**: Number of Orders by Segment.
- **Measure 4**: Profit Margin by Product Category and Subcategory.
- **Measure 5**: Sales Performance by Region.
- **Measure 6**: Relationship between Shipping Mode and Delivery Efficiency.

## Insights and Analysis

### 1. Sales Revenue Trends
- Analyzed total sales over time to detect seasonality and trends in customer demand.
- Highlighted peak sales periods, indicating optimal times for promotions and stock replenishment.

### 2. Discount Impact on Sales and Profitability
- Investigated how discount percentages influenced sales volume and overall profit margins.
- Found that while higher discounts drove sales volume, they negatively impacted profit margins for certain categories.

### 3. Customer Segment Analysis
- Identified key customer segments (Corporate, Home Office, Consumer) and their contribution to total revenue.
- Corporate customers generated the highest revenue, while Home Office customers had a higher average order size.

### 4. Product Category and Subcategory Analysis
- Explored sales distribution across various product categories such as Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology.
- Technology products, although fewer in quantity, accounted for a higher percentage of total revenue.

### 5. Shipping Mode Analysis
- Compared different shipping modes (Standard, Express, Same-Day) to assess their impact on delivery time and customer satisfaction.
- Standard shipping was the most used mode but often led to delayed deliveries in certain regions.

## Final Dashboard and Visuals
A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook report with visuals was created to display the following:

- **Sales Trends** over time and by region.
- **Discount Analysis** and its impact on profitability.
- **Category and Subcategory Performance** insights.
- **Customer Segmentation** with insights into segment-wise revenue.
- **Shipping Mode and Delivery Time Analysis**.
